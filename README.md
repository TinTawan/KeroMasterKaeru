Kero Master: Kaeru

A 3D platformer Collectathon group project. Switch between first and third person perspectives to move between catching and platforming modes. Use your frog tongue to grapple onto vines and catch flies to fill your stomach!

Created by Justin Ward, Ranen Fernandes and Andrei Constantin during Term 2 of First Year for the Games and Interactive Systems module.
